I plan on using this project in order to give me a better understanding of the 
c++ language as well as a decent grasp on creating my own game from scratch. 
The game I want to create is a tetris rip off except everything I will code from 
scratch only using the internet to look for specific libraries and possibly 
design patterns in order to better break down the overall project into smaller 
chunks.

The individual components will be:
--Game Board
--Pieces
--Player Input
--Start Screen
--Pause Screen
--Exit Screen
